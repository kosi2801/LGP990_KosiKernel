config RAMZSWAP
	tristate "Compressed in-memory swap device (ramzswap)"
	depends on SWAP
	default n
	help
	  Creates virtual block devices which can (only) be used as swap
	  disks. Pages swapped to these disks are compressed and stored in
	  memory itself.

	  See ramzswap.txt for more information.
	  Project home: http://compcache.googlecode.com/
	  Modded by kosi2801 to use buildin Snappy compression instead of LZO.

config RAMZSWAP_STATS
	bool "Enable ramzswap stats"
	depends on RAMZSWAP
	default y
	help
	  Enable statistics collection for ramzswap. This adds only a minimal
	  overhead. In unsure, say Y.

config RAMZSWAP_OLD_COMPRESSION
	bool "Use old LZO compression algorithm instead of Snappy for ramzswap"
	depends on RAMZSWAP
        select LZO_COMPRESS
        select LZO_DECOMPRESS
	default y
	help
	  This replaces the default Snappy compression of the ramzswap device 
	  with the slower but more efficient LZO algorithm. 
	  In unsure, say Y.
