	  Creates virtual block devices called /dev/zramX (X = 0, 1, ...).
	  Pages written to these disks are compressed and stored in memory
	  itself. These disks allow very fast I/O and compression provides
	  good amounts of memory savings.

	  It has several use cases, for example: /tmp storage, use as swap
	  disks and maybe many more.

	  See zram.txt for more information.

          This replaces the default Snappy compression of the zram device 
          with the slower but more efficient LZO algorithm. 
          In unsure, say Y.

	  Compresses relatively unused page cache pages and stores them in
	  memory itself. This increases effective memory size and can help
	  reduce access to backing store device(s) which is typically much
	  slower than access to main memory.
